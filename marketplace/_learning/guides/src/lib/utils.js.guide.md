# Guide: src/lib/utils.js
**Role in the system**: Shared server-side domain logic used by routes and components to keep business rules centralized.
**Key concepts you'll learn**:
- control flow
- module boundaries
**Prerequisites**:
- No hard prerequisites. You can read this guide directly.

## Line-by-Line Walkthrough

### Section 1: Lines 13-18
```js
13: export function numeric(value, fallback = 0) {
14:   const n = Number(value);
15:   return Number.isFinite(n) ? n : fallback;
16: }
17: 
18: 
```
**What it does**: This section encodes business logic in a reusable function. API routes and components call into this layer so rules stay centralized instead of duplicated.

> **Concept callouts:**
- This block is mostly structural wiring (imports/export boundaries).

**What would happen if...** What if we remove this block entirely? Trace callers and consumers first, because other parts of the app likely depend on this contract.

**Extra example**:
```js
function formatPrice(cents) {
  return `$${(cents / 100).toFixed(2)}`;
}
```

## Concepts Summary
| Line(s) | Concept | Quick Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| n/a | module structure | This file mostly wires exports/imports and delegates behavior. |

## Common Mistakes
- Mutating objects/arrays directly instead of returning new values, which can break predictable state and data flow.
- Forgetting `await` on async operations, then trying to use unresolved Promise objects as if they were final data.
- Skipping input validation/error handling around external input (`request.json()`, query params), leading to runtime edge-case bugs.
- Replacing `.map()`/`.filter()` pipelines with side-effect-heavy loops that make transformations harder to reason about.

## Exercises
1. **Easy**: Find one `.map()` or `.filter()` usage in this file and rewrite it with a `for` loop. Compare readability and bug risk.
2. **Medium**: Add one small feature in this file (new field, new validation rule, or extra UI branch) while keeping updates immutable.
3. **Stretch**: Refactor one async path to improve failure handling (network/db error + empty state) and document the before/after behavior.
